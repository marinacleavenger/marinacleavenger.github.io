<b>Three WODs</b>

I first read the directions for the three WODs and initially felt worried. I read all the modules and did all of the practices in the previous modules, but I had a fear I did not retain as much as I would like to. As I was going through BrowserHistory1, I recalled that there were some aspects we did in Lab1 and Lab2 that helped me accomplish the task. For example, we had to understand how files were linked, paths, how to start the localhost 8080. This took me about three times to do BrowserHistory1. The problem was that I tried to do it the first time recording, and each time I messed up I would restart. That was taking too long and I decided it was better to really study, take notes, and complete it all the way through before going through it. Once I did that, I would stop for a few seconds in the screen recording, but then I would remember the path I took and completed it in a good amount of time. <br>

BrowserHistory2 was much easier for me. I was doing the W3 schools and there was actually a very long video about how to add in images, how to link it to the .css file, and how to add in an image link. For Lab2, I saw that there was exta credit if I changed certain things, so I was able to learn how to insert fonts as well the week before. I am glad I did the extra credit and did some further research during the week, because it truly paid off in this Wod. I encountered a problem during my screen cast, the link to the chrome image did not work, but I just went online and took it into my own hands to get another Chrome logo picture. This entire process only took me less than 7 minutes. <br>

BrowserHistory3 was more challenging for me. I was working with things I truly was unfamiliar with. I did not know much about a div and naming code for .css. I tried to figure it out as much as I could, but then I looked at the screencast to help me. During the screencast, it was more helpful to hear about the "why" this is happening, then copying step by step. I was writing out the divs and until he said "it is for naming each section to tell the .css file" I ended up pausing the screencast and finishing up that section to myself.
