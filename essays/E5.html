  <b>Reflecting on Assignment 2 Technical Essay</b> <br>
<br>Assignment 2 has a fully functional login page. It will draw from the user_data.json to make sure the password and username match. If they don’t, it will relay a validation message and you will not be able to “purchase” the item. When you login, the purchase will be sticky and you can proceed. 

<br>
<br>I learned a lot from Assignment 2, especially more about the importance of a propper app.post and the functions of a “POST” in general. I also learned different ways to use functions to see where 

<br>
<br> I did not work with a partner, but I was able to attend many study sessions and gain insight from other people about their code. 
<br> I needed help with the Registration page most of all. It was not added to my user_data.json file, so I was having trouble registering people, even though the login page was fully functional. I had reached out for help constantly. Whether this be classmates, people who have taken the class previously, professor, the TA, friends, anyone I could get in contact with to learn more. 

<br>
<br>This assignment was very different because there were a lot of server side things to do other than client side. Assignment 2 focused more on updating json files and making them interact with each other, when Assignment 1 was more about validation and how the web page looked. 

<br>
<br>I thought about the code around 20%, the writing of the code was 30%, and the testing and debugging the code was 50%. 

<br>
<br>What worked well with this project was the fact I was familiar with the pre-existing code that was in Assignment 1. I knew where to declare variables or add in additions. I also knew very well about assignment 1. Assignment 2 did not work as well because I did not know what exactly I was doing at times. I knew the end goal, but I did not have any notes or previous knowledge on how to reach my goal. This caused a lot of stalling, talking to people, and writing different types of code. 
<br>
<br>If I could go back in time, I would definitely research more on server side processes. I did the reading and modules, but I did not have enough time to do further research outside of class time to prepare for this assignment.
