***Why I chose MIS***

Choosing Management Information Systems was a long process I went through for the past two years. I was originally a Management major, but when I took the first major level course freshman year of college, I realized that I wanted to do more than what was offered in the major. I looked into all the business majors such as Marketing, Accounting, Entrepreneurship, and etc. I was lost, and at that time, I did not know that Management Information Systems existed. 

That summer I took ICS 101 (Intro to Computer Science). I heard my friends say it was a really hard class that they didn't enjoy. I was pleasantly surprised when it became one of my favorite classes. I loved completing tasks based on structure and organization.

First semester of my sophomore year of college I was enrolled into BUS 310 (Business Statistics) and BUS 311 (Information Systems). From those two classes, the spark for technology and business crossing over excited me. I was first introduced to Management Information System in BUS 311. SQL, Access Database, and Salesforce were my favorite topics we learned. From there, I did a lot of research about MIS. I met with multiple MIS majors, I talked to people who have the degree, and spent too much time on Youtube learning about the major.  

In the end, I decided to officially change my major/direction. What attracted me most was that I would never stop learning after I completed the degree. Also, the classes seemed very interesting to me that I would take at UH in the future.
