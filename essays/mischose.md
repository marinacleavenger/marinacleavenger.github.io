***Why I chose MIS***

Choosing Management Information Systems was a long process I went through the past two years. I was orginally a Management major, but when I took the first major level course freshmen year of college, I realized that I wanted to do more than what was offered in the major. I did not know what to do or where to go from there. I looked into all the business majors such as Marketing, Accounting, Entreprenuership, and etc. I was lost, and at that time, I did not know what Management Information Systems was. 

That summer I took ICS 101 (Intro to computer science). I heard my friends say it was a really hard class and that they did not enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised when it became one of my favorite classes I have taken. I loved the structure and organization of how to accomplish tasks. 

Second semester of my freshmen year of college I was enrolled into BUS 310 (business tatistics) and BUS 311 (Information Systems). I was secretly dreading the classes because I thought they would be difficult and not interesting. I could not have been more wrong. I have never taken a class that I was naturally good at until BUS 310. I loved what I was doing and was excited for class. 

## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
