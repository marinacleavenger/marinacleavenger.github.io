***Why I chose MIS***

Choosing Management Information Systems was a long process I went through the past two years. I was originally a Management major, but when I took the first major level course freshman year of college, I realized that I wanted to do more than what was offered in the major. I did not know what to do or where to go from there. I looked into all the business majors such as Marketing, Accounting, Entrepreneurship, and etc. I was lost, and at that time, I did not know what Management Information Systems was. 

That summer I took ICS 101 (Intro to computer science). I heard my friends say it was a really hard class and that they did not enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised when it became one of my favorite classes I have taken. I loved the structure and organization of how to accomplish tasks. 

First semester of my sophomore year of college I was enrolled into BUS 310 (Business Statistics) and BUS 311 (Information Systems). I was secretly dreading the classes because I thought they would be difficult and not interesting. I could not have been more wrong. I have never taken a class that I was naturally good at until BUS 310. I loved what I was doing and was excited for both classes. I was first introduced to Management Information System in BUS 311. SQL, Access Database, and Salesforce were my favorite topics we learned. From there, I did a lot of research about MIS. I met with multiple MIS majors over coffee, I talked to professionals who have the degree, and conducted many research hours on Youtube. 

In the end, I saw how Management Information Systems is needed in society and for the future. Bridging the gap between technology and business is so important and I am excited to learn more about it in the future.
